### 


As an AI Product Manager, I wanted to showcase my skills by building something practical.

🎯 What it does:
Analyzes your resume against any job description and tells you:
- Which skills match (with evidence from your resume)
- Which skills are weakly represented
- Critical missing must-have skills
- Optional nice-to-have skills

🤖 Technical approach:
Built using GPT-4o with carefully engineered prompts that:
✅ Understand "React.js" = "React" (semantic matching)
✅ Distinguish C++ ≠ C (strict language matching)
✅ Detect weak representations ("Worked with AWS" vs "Built AWS infrastructure serving 1M users")

💡 Key PM insight:
Instead of just showing matched/missing skills, I focused on ACTIONABILITY - telling users exactly WHY a skill is weak and HOW to improve it.
